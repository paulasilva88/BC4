Have you ever felt wonder
Like thunder
When it knocks you on the floor
Whoa-oh
And you can't explain the feeling
That you're feeling
That you never felt before
No-oh-oh

And sometimes it's so painful
But you can't walk away from
When it's worth giving all you got

That's how you know this is love
L.O.V.E., love
You can't get enough
It won't let you go
Then you know this is love (love)
L.O.V.E., love (love)
I fall when we touch
If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love

Even though you're not supposed to
You feel closer
When you're a thousand miles away
Oh-oh
Makes you happy in your own skin
Without a warning
And you know that something's changed
Oh-whoa-oh

And you're scared 'cause you're falling
'Cause the truth is you're all in
But it's worth giving all you got

That's how you know this is love
L.O.V.E., love
You can't get enough
It won't let you go
Then you know this is love (love)
L.O.V.E., love (love)
I fall when we touch
If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love

L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E., love
(If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love)
L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E., love
(If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love)

And you're scared 'cause you're falling
'Cause the truth is you're all in
But it's worth giving all you got

That's how you know this is love
L.O.V.E., love
You can't get enough
It won't let you go
Then you know this is love (love)
L.O.V.E., love (love)
I fall when we touch
If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love

L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E., love
(If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love)
L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E., love
(If you keep wanting more
Then you know this is love)
