[Dua Lipa:]
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

[Dua Lipa & RosÃ©:]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Dua Lipa:]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, ki-kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, ki-kiss and make up
Ki-kiss and make up
Kiss and make, ki-kiss and make up
Ki-kiss and make up
Kiss and make, ki-kiss and make up
